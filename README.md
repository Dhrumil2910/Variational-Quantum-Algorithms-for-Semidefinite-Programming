# Variational-Quantum-Algorithms-for-Semidefinite-Programming

This repository contains codes of variational quantum algorithms proposed in our [paper](https://pages.github.com/) for solving semidefinite programs:
  
Dependencies:
  ```
  numpy
  scipy
  cvxpy
  qiskit
  pennylane
  networkx
```
  
Two of the algorithms use qiskit-aqua package which deprecated recently. We intend to incorporate new packages in the future. For now in order to install this package, use the following pip command:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aqua.git
```
